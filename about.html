	<h2>Rick Sanchez</h2>
	<img src="Rick_Sanchez.jpeg">
	<p>Rick Sanchez is a sociopathic, emotionally abusive, nihilistic, cynical, narcissistic, self-centered, incredibly intelligent alcoholic, mad scientist/genius who is the father of Beth Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer. His alcoholic tendencies lead his daughter's family to worry about the safety of their son Morty. He frequently 'burp-talks' words in the middle of a sentence while speaking, presumably as a result of his alcoholism. He is identified as Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-137. In "The Wedding Squanchers", Rick and his friends Squanchy and Birdperson were revealed to be freedom fighters against the Galactic Federation who labeled them terrorists with warrants for their arrest. He is constantly going on adventures throughout the universe, galaxy and in some cases different dimensions with his grandson Morty who is the complete opposite of Rick and shows a very low IQ. The character was inspired primarily by Emmett Brown from Back to the Future.</p>

	<h2>Morty Sanchez</h2>
	<img src="Morty_Smith.jpeg">
	<p>Morty Smith is Rick's 14-year-old grandson who is constantly dragged into Rick's adventures. Morty is a good kid but he is easily distress. He always ends up following Rick's plans, and he often ends up traumatized by the unorthodox and morally questionable methods Rick uses to "fix" situations. In "Raising Gazorpazorp" he accidentally impregnates an alien breeding robot (which he bought at an alien sex shop thinking it was a normal sex doll), which gives birth to his half-alien son, Mortimer Smith Jr. Throughout the series, several characters mention that Morty has a learning disability, and he often displays low self-esteem. Despite this, he's shown to be intelligent and resourceful at times and as the series progresses he learns how to use many of Rick's devices and even manipulates Rick into taking Jerry on an adventure. By the end of season three he displays an uncanny degree of common sense as well as a deep understanding of Rick's twisted mind, as seen in "Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender". The character was inspired primarily by Marty McFly from Back to the Future.</p>

	<h2>Summer Smith</h2>
	<img src="Summer_Smith.jpeg">
	<p>Summer Smith is Morty's 17-year-old older sister, a more conventional and often superficial teenager, who is obsessed with improving her status among her peers. In some episodes she shoes emotions that she doesn't really care what's going on in the house but in others she feels left out and just wants to be part of Rick and Morty adventures and she expresses jealousy that Morty gets to accompany Rick on his inter-dimensional adventures. In the second season, she accompanies Rick and Morty on adventures more frequently and sometimes will even prove herself to be more competent than Morty, especially when emotional nuance is required. Summer has, on occasion, been shown to think similar to Rick, such as quickly figuring out a way to save herself and Rick from execution, and correctly deducing that dead flies in Rick's garage were more than they appeared. Summer cares about Rick and sees him as a hero, though he is often contemptuous and dismissive of her teenaged life perspective and values. In "The Rickshank Rickdemption", she is the only member of the family who wants to rescue Rick, despite the pleas of her brother that Rick is nothing more than a selfish jerk. When their parents agreed on a divorce, Summer began resenting her father and started showing her dark side whether its sex with some random guy from a dimension where earth is like the movie Mad Max or not caring if she dies she goes on this rampage until she reconciles with her father.</p>

	<h2>Beth Smith</h2>
	<img src="Beth_Smith.jpg">
	<p>Beth Smith is Rick's daughter, Summer and Morty's mother. She is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she internally feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her career is compared to human medicine. Level-headed and assertive, she struggles with her husband's ego, which thrives in defiance of his proven mediocrity. Several episodes have dealt with Beth's deep dissatisfaction with her life, stemming from her belief that she has "settled" in her marriage, family, and job. She wanted to become a "real" surgeon but became pregnant with Summer at 17. She is the most assertive force in her household, while also displaying traits of selfishness, humor, and intelligence. Beth is unperturbed by her father's destructive and dangerous tendencies around her son. She, from childhood, views Rick more favorably than her mother due to the parental separation. Harmon expanded upon this origin in an interview: "Kids can sometimes idolize their worst parent and blame their supportive parent for chasing off the dad with the guts to leave. She believes that Rick, as crazy as he is, is the better of her two parents even though she was raised by her mother and she blames her mother's remarkability on her father's departure and will do anything to keep her father back in her life.". In "The ABC's of Beth", it is revealed that Beth shares the same sociopathic tendencies as her father. After Rick offers to make Beth a clone of herself to tend to her family while she can explore the multiverse, she begins to believe that she herself is the clone and goes to Jerry for help. Beth realizes that she loves Jerry, and calls off the divorce, renewing her bond with her family and no longer insecure about Rick abandoning her again.</p>

	<h2>Jerry Smith</h2>
	<img src="Jerry_Smith.jpeg">
	<p>Jerry Smith is Summer and Morty's insecure father he strongly disapproves of Rick's influence over his family. Jerry used to work at a low-level advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence. Generally insecure, he is frequently led into conflicts stemming from opportunistic posturing, while his marriage is sometimes jeopardized by his wife's reactions to his poor relationship with Rick. However, it is strongly suggested that in spite of their problems, they are emotionally codependent. The episode "Mortynight Run" reveals that one of the Ricks, keenly aware that every Jerry is incapable of surviving off of Earth, created a daycare where every Jerry is dropped off by their Rick and Morty during adventures should they attempt to accompany them. It is revealed in the same episode that in some dimensions, Beth has left Jerry and remarried. By the end of "The Wedding Squanchers", having attempted to talk his family into selling Rick out, Jerry becomes the only member of the family to benefit from the Earth joining the Galactic Federation. After the federation collapses, Jerry puts his foot down and tells Beth it is him or Rick, but Beth chooses her father and tells Rick she and Jerry are getting a divorce. Rick later claims to Morty in a rant that he planned this because Jerry had planned to betray him. In one episode Rick and Jerry go on an adventure and get into an argument when Jerry says to Rick "You self-righteous piece of shit you took my family" then Rick replies with "I took your family? Who do you think got more taken away from them when you shot 20 cc's of liquid dream killer into my daughter? She was Rick's daughter Jerry she had options, that all ended because she felt sorry for you. You act like prey but you're a predator you use pity to lure in your victims it's how you survive. I survive because I know everything and snakes survive because children wander off and you survive because people think "Oh this poor piece of shit he never gets a break I can't stand the defining silent wailes of his wilted soul I guess I'll hire him or marry him."</p>
