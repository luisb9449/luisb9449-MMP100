		<h1>Rick and Morty</h1>
		<p>One reason Rick and Morty is an amazing show is its number of iconic and memorable episodes, Rick and Morty adventures are vivid, wild spontaneous and just down right outrighteous. A key reason for this is the sheer absurdity of the episodes.Rick and Morty make the most of its animation medium, using it not as a point of differentiation, but as a platform to fulfil the madness the show desires. There are no boundaries or limits to the show Rick and Morty can go anywhere and do anything they want. Rick and Morty isn't your everyday animated comedy. It is filled with layered and often emotional narrative arcs, guiding us through the episodes. This is because Rick and Morty nails the balance between hilarious comedy and heartbreaking tragedy. Creators Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon imbue their comedy with profound philosophy and meditations on life. Primarily, this revolves around the question of meaning  or perhaps, more fittingly, meaninglessness.The depth of Rick and Morty is helped by the believable nature of its characters. We wouldn't have batted an eyelid if Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon had chosen to simply make Rick and Morty an exhibition of crazy sci-fi adventures, without a secondary layer of meaning. With an entire universe of madness to explore, human nature could very much take a back seat. Instead though, the characters in Rick and Morty all just feel so real. Within every character you can always see a piece of yourself or friends and family especially when it's people who you know very close. As a result, when shit hits the fan, we're not just invested because we've been taught to be invested in our protagonists. We're invested because we care about the characters. In moments of heartbreak, we don't just feel sad, but we feel affected. Rick and Morty is an exploration of humanity, and one that teaches us what it's like to be alive. Bottom line is, Rick and Morty becomes more than just your standard comedy. It fuses moments of real darkness with moments of hilarity, and it works seamlessly. This is a brilliant, and totally irreverent commentary on our world.</p>
